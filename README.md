🍕 Pizza React Project

This project is a React-based application that manages data about various pizzas. It allows users to explore different pizza types, and the pizza data is reused for various components and purposes throughout the app. This project is built as part of Jonas Schmedtmann's Ultimate React Course.

📚 Features

Pizza Data Management: The app contains a list of different pizzas, each with details such as name, ingredients, and price.
Reusable Components: Pizza data is used in various components to demonstrate reusability and scalability within a React application.
Responsive UI: Built using modern frontend tools and design patterns to ensure a great experience across devices.
State Management: Managed using React's built-in hooks for efficient state control.
Dynamic Rendering: Pizza components dynamically render based on the provided data, demonstrating React’s powerful rendering engine.

🛠️ Technologies Used
React: For building the UI and managing state.
TailwindCSS: For styling and ensuring the app is responsive.
Chakra UI (Optional): Could be used for some components and form validation.
JavaScript/TypeScript: JavaScript used with the option for TypeScript support.
Webpack/Vite: For bundling the app (depending on your setup).
